> A brief description of what your app will be like and why it's interesting. 

According to foodallergy.org “33 million Americans have food allergies” leaving “1 in 10 adults [and] 1 in 13 children” to deal with food choice difficulties.  

While we can’t remove allergens, we want to try to facilitate some lives by designing an application that will make it easier for people with food allergies to find/order both safe; restaurants, and meals to eat meanwhile lessening the fear of contamination. 

The app should be able to: 

    Allow **customers** to place an order with their allergens displayed to restaurant.
    
    Allow **restaurants** to ceate their menu items listing ingredients, recieve an order with their clients special instructions automatically given. 

    Allow **drivers**, to receive order and deliver to client.

    Allow customers to find their favorite restaurants and place an order with them.

    Allow customers to order food and the app automatically detect the allergens and autofill in the text book to remove certain allergens from a meal.

    If a meal doesnt contain a list of ingredients, then customer is warned that their food may contain food allergen.
