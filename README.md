> A brief description of what your app will be like and why it's interesting. 

According to foodallergy.org “33 million Americans have food allergies” leaving “1 in 10 adults [and] 1 in 13 children” to deal with food choice difficulties.  

While we can’t remove allergens, we want to try to facilitate some lives by designing an application that will make it easier for people with food allergies to find/order both safe; restaurants, and meals to eat meanwhile lessening the fear of contamination. 

The app should be able to: 

    Allow **customers** to communicate their experiences with certain restaurants by writing reviews.
    
    Allow **restaurants** to communicate with a customer’s review, whether that customer left a positive or negative concern. 

    Allow **drivers**, to communicate with restaurant/customers.

    Implement a rewards system for restaurant that depend on the ingredients that they list for meals. The more meals with ingredients listed, the more rewards.

    Allow customers to find allergy friendly restaurants near them in GSO.

    Allow customers to order food and the app automatically detect the allergens and autofill in the text book to remove certain allergens from a meal.

    If a meal doesnt contain a list of ingredients, then custoemr is warned that their food may contain food allergen.
