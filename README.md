According to foodallergy.org “33 million Americans have food allergies” leaving “1 in 10 adults [and] 1 in 13 children” to deal with food choice difficulties.  

While we can’t remove allergens, we want to try to facilitate some lives by designing an application that will make it easier for people with food allergies to find both safe; restaurants, and meals to eat lessening the fear of contamination. 

The app should be able to: 

    Allow customers to communicate their experiences with certain restaurants by writing reviews.  

    Allow people to find allergy friendly restaurants near them. 

    Allow people to use a bar code scanner to identify possible allergen threats. 

    Allow restaurants to communicate with a customer’s review, whether that customer left a positive or negative concern. 

    Allow for moderators to ensure there are no inappropriate comments/posts being made.
